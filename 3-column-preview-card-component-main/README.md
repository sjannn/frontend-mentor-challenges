# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component



## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

To build this page I was using only HTML and CSS. The layout is done with Flexbox. Use CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:root`. The `@media` also turned out to be useful for the process of making the page responsive, despite having more uses that we will discover later. Here are some links that may be useful.
